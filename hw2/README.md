# Machine Learning: Homework 2

## Directories
- `percepton/`: problem 3
- `svm/`: problem 4
- `multiperceptron/`: problem 5

## Dependencies
This homework assignment was completed using the latest Anaconda package
for Python 3.6.

Specifically it relies on:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Running code
For each problem there is a package with files in it.

To run the code, first make sure you have all the dependencies,
then from the homework2 root, run `python3 <package_name>/<file_name>.py`

Certain files have lines, such as datasets/kernels commented out, so it
might be worth playing around with the code to see different results.
